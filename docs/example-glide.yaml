  # Minimal definition
  # This will use "go get [-u]" to fetch and update the package, and it will
  # attempt to keep the release at the tip of master. It does this by looking
  # for telltale signs that this is a git, bzr, or hg repo, and then acting
  # accordingly.
  - package: github.com/kylelemons/go-gypsy

  # Full definition
  # This will check out the given Git repo, set the reference to master,
  # use "git" (not "go get") to manage it, and alias the package to the
  # import path github.com/Masterminds/cookoo
  - package: github.com/Masterminds/cookoo
    vcs: git
    ref: master
    repo: git@github.com:Masterminds/cookoo.git

  # Here's an example with a commit hash for a ref. Since repo is not specified,
  # this will use "go get" to fetch and update the package, but try to use
  # the VCS (git, in this case) to set the ref.

  # MASKING: This takes my fork of goamz (technosophos/goamz) and clones it
  # as if it were the crowdmob/goamz package. This is incredibly useful for
  # masking packages and/or working with forks or clones.
  #
  # Note that absolutely no namespace munging happens on the code. If you want
  # that, you'll have to do it on your own. The intent of this masking was to
  # make it so you don't have to vendor imports.
