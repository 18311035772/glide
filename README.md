# Glide: Managing Go Projects With Ease

**WARNING:** Glide is currently not stable and not complete. It's highly
experimental.

Glide is a tool for managing Go projects. It is intended to do the
following:

* Manage project-specific `GOPATH`s
* Ease dependency management
* Support versioning in packages
* Remove the need for "vendoring" or munging import statements
* Support "prebuilding" of dependencies
in
And it does all of this with a simple tool and a simple JSON format.

## The Name

Aside from being catchy, "glide" is a contraction of "Go Elide". The
idea is to compress the tasks that normally take us lots of time into a
just a few seconds.
